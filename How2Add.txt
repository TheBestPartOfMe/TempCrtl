U will need to add the py Code to ur startup, so that
the program will start automatically.

Got to the terminal after u saved the TempCrtl.py somewhere u will find it again
In the terminal paste the line:
  sudo crontab -e
Copy paste:
  @reboot python3 <place of the TempCrtl.py>
Now reboot ur pi and it should work
